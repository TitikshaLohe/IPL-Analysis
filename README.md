# Analyse historical IPL data and provide insight on IPL 2024 for Sports magazine

This project was part of resume challenge conducted by Codebasics.

## Overview: 
"Sports Basics" is a sports blog company. They released a special edition magazine on the 
 2024 Indian Premier League to increase visitors to their website. Based on data from the 
 previous three years, this magazine seeks to offer fascinating information and insights for 
 fans, analysts, and teams.

## Objective: 
 1) As a data-savvy cricket enthusiast, I performed primary and secondary analysis.
 2) To design a dashboard showing key metrics, player summary and team performance.

## Findings:
1) Best 11 players selected based on their positions and last three years data performance for IPL 2024
2) The last three years were analyzed to predict the Title winner, Orange Cap holder and Purple Cap holder for season 2024.
The important key metrics, team performance and player summary were analyzed.

Feel free to add any suggestions or thoughts you may have.
